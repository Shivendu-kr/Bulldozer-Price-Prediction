# Bulldozer Price Prediction: Machine Learning Algorithm Project

This project leverages Machine Learning to predict the prices of bulldozers based on historical data. The model is trained using a dataset of bulldozer sales, and the prediction is done via regression techniques. This repository contains all the necessary code, data, and environment configuration to run the project.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an end-to-end Machine Learning model that predicts bulldozer prices. This is achieved through data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training. The entire workflow is documented in Jupyter Notebooks to allow easy understanding and reproducibility.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting useful features from the data to improve the model's accuracy.
- **Modeling**: Using regression algorithms to predict the bulldozer prices.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.
